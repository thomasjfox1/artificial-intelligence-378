Prepare a list of rules for a restaurant selection inference engine. Consider such crieria as:

location (or just distance from the diner)
price range
type of cuisine
diner's allergies
atmosphere (dignified, boisterous, etc.)
rating (unrated, 0, 1, 2, or 3 stars)
anything else you think would be relevant (be creative)
The rule base should consist of assertions about specific restaurants. The input will be the prospective diner's preferences or constraints.

Assume that the output will be a list of recommended restaurants that satisfy the input constraints or preferences, but you don't actually have to run the query.

Prepare the rule base and the inputs in Clojure form. For this exercise you don't have to execute anything, but you should at least get Clojure to validate your syntax.
