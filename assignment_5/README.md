Prepare a Prolog representation of the main geneology of the British royal family, starting with Victoria and Albert through the present.

It should be able to respond to inquiries about the Ancestor, Descendant, Parent, Child, Sibling, etc. of a given individual, and perhaps other relationships.

If you're not sure of all the individuals in that family tree, don't worry. You won't be graded on the correctness of the rosters. But it is easy to find the needed information on the Internet.

I used this source as the basis of the family tree:
